//+PLUMEDOC TOPOLOGY MOLINFO
/*
This command is used to provide information on the molecules that are present in your system.

The information on the molecules in your system can either be provided in the form of a pdb file
or as a set of lists of atoms that describe the various chains in your system. If a pdb file
is used plumed the MOLINFO command will endeavor to recognize the various chains and residues that
make up the molecules in your system using the chainIDs and resnumbers from the pdb file. You can
then use this information in later commands to specify atom lists in terms residues.  For example
using this command you can find the backbone atoms in your structure automatically. 

Please be aware that the pdb parser in plumed is far from perfect. You should thus check the log file
and examine what plumed is actually doing whenenver you use the MOLINFO action.

Using MOLINFO with a protein's pdb extend the possibility of atoms selection using the @ special
symbol. Current registered keywords are:

\verbatim
@phi-#
@psi-#
@omega-#
@chi1-#
\endverbatim

that select the appropriate atoms that define each dihedral angle for residue #.

\bug At the moment the HA1 atoms in a GLY residues are treated as if they are the CB atoms. This may or
may not be true - GLY is problematic for secondary structure residues as it is achiral. 

\bug If you use WHOLEMOLECULES RESIDUES=1-10 for a 18 amino acid protein 
( 18 amino acids + 2 terminal groups = 20 residues ) the code will fail as it will not be able to 
interpret termnal residue 1.

\par Examples

In the following example the MOLINFO command is used to provide the information on which atoms
are in the backbone of a protein to the ALPHARMSD CV.

\verbatim
MOLINFO STRUCTURE=reference.pdb
ALPHARMSD BACKBONE=all TYPE=DRMSD LESS_THAN={RATIONAL R_0=0.08 NN=8 MM=12} LABEL=a 
\endverbatim
(see also \ref ALPHARMSD)

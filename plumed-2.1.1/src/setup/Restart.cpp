//+PLUMEDOC GENERIC RESTART
/*
Activate restart.

This is a Setup directive and, as such, should appear
at the beginning of the input file.

\par Examples

Using the following input:
\verbatim
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
PRINT ARG=d FILE=out
\endverbatim
a new 'out' file will be created. If an old one is on the way, it will be automatically backed up.
On the other hand, using the following input:
\verbatim
RESTART
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
PRINT ARG=d FILE=out
\endverbatim
the file 'out' will be appended.
(See also \ref DISTANCE and \ref PRINT).

\attention
This directive can have also other side effects, e.g. on \ref METAD

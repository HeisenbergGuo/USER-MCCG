This directory contains many subdirectories

lib/ after compilation contains all plumed files which should be in the path
maketools/ contains some tool necessary for compilation

Then these directories are built and linked using special rules:
config/  contains some files generated based on system configuration
main/    contains the main() program for plumed executable
wrapper/ contains the wrappers for MD codes

All the other directories are "modules". Modules are of three type:
* always compiled (necessary for plumed to properly link)
* default on, can be switched off touching a file modulename.off in the src/ directory
* default off, can be switched on touching a file modulename.on in the src/ directory
Notice that these .on and .off files are not to be distributed/included in git,
as they reflect local wishes!

As a quick trick to enable all modules, including those which are off by default
make mod-heavy

On the other hand, to disable all modules which are not compulsory:
make mod-light
Notice that this will result in a library which cannot do anything, but can be useful
to quickly compile tool library

To reset modules, removing all .on and .off files:
make mod-reset

The type of the module can be set by adding a file module.type (see e.g. core/module.type)
